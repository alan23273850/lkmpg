# The Linux Kernel Module Programming Guide

This project keeps the Linux Kernel Module Programming Guide reasonably up to date, with [working examples](examples/) for recent 5.x kernel versions.
The guide has been around since 2001 and most copies of it on the web only describe old 2.6.x kernels.

The book can be freely accessed via https://sysprog21.github.io/lkmpg/
The original guide may be found at [Linux Documentation Project](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/lkmpg/).
